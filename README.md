# todo-list

Create a simple todo list app. This project emphasizes on Single Responsibility principle and more webpack practice.
Things that I do:

1. Buttons and their functionalities through event delegation technique.
2. Modal.
3. Initial task and project data structures with objects and arrays.
4. Adding new task and new project in the interface.
5. Basic nav switches.
6. Clearing modal after modal is closed.
7. Formating and checking if a date is past date using `date-fns` library.
8. Trimming form values.
9. Priority feature.
10. Task deletion logic using `find` method.
11. Filtering task array using `filter` method.
12. Inline `svg` in JavaScript using this webpack config:

```js
      {
        test: /\.svg/,
        type: 'asset/inline'
      }
```
13. Basic task count feature.

Things that AIs do:
1. All `localStorage` functionalities.
2. Large refactor of the data structures and classes.
3. Tasks availability feature.
4. Improve dates comparison.
5. Switch to the Inbox menu if current project is removed.
6. Dynamically change the task count (related to the large refactor).
